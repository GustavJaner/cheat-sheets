# Vim commands

## Copy and Paste

### Paste continuously from register
`yy` - yank line
`p`  - paste

Several commands all store to the " (unnamed) register.
So when deleting text using x or similar, this buffer(characters) will be stored in the " (unnamed) register and overwrite the previous yanked line.

Yanked text is also put in the 0 register automatically.
regiter 0 is not afftected by delete or other change operations: use it to paste after intermediate deletes
`"0p` - paste buffer from register "0

Or store the yanked line to a specific register:
`"ayy` - yank like and store to register "a
`"ap`  - paste buffer from register "a
